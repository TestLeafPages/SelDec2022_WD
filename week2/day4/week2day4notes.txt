     OOPs:
     =====
       Object Oriented Programmin language 
       based on the concept of objects
       It can contains data-methods,variables/logic

     4 concepts in OOPs  :
     ====================
       -Inheritance
       -Polymorphism
       -Abstraction
       -Encapsulation

     Major Benefits:
     ==============
       ->Reusability
       ->Flexibility
       ->Efficient  

      Inheritance:
      =============
         -One of the most commonly used OOPs concept
         -It is the concept of building relationship between 2 similar classes(parent-child)
         -To have the common functions 
         -To avoid dupliacte implementation
         -To reduce the code

       Types of Inheritance:
       ====================
          -Single (parent-child)
          -Multilevel(GrandParent-Parent-Child)
          -Multiple
          -Hierarchy

         Single Inheritance:
         ==================
            Parent-Child
            extends Keyword

         Classroom:
         ==========
           1)Create a class called Vehicle(2 methods)
               -Truck(one method)
                 -AshokLeyland(2 methods)

               -Jeep (one method)
                 -Mahindra (one method)
           2)Create an Execution Class(MyVehicle)
           3)Create an object for AshokLeyland and call all the methods  
           4)Create an object for Mahindra and call all the methods

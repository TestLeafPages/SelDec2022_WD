Today's Agenda:

   9:30-9:45->TestNG Introduction
   9:45-11:00->Sequential,Parallel Execution
   11:00-11:30->Classroom
   11:30-12:15->WebTable
   12:15-12:30->Classroom
Limitations:
 
 1)One by One(50 automated testcases)
   -Time Consuming
   -Manually someone have to be present
   -Same Data
   
  Expectation:
    
    -Run automatedly-Parallel

2)Run for hardcoded Data 
    Expectation:Run for Different data   

3)There is no reporting
    Expectation:Atleast basic report(how many passed,failed,skipped)

4)There is no way to rerun the test on failure
    Expectation:automated retry

5)There  is no way to filter the tests to Run
    Expectation:Automated grouping would be nice


TestNG
   
   -Test Execution FrameWork
   -Full of configuration

2-Step Process
   
   -TestNG as Plugin(To run as testng xml file)
   -TestNG as Jar(to understand the software)

Steps to Convert a normal testcase to testNg:

  1)Convert main method to normal method
    -Remove static
    -Remove arguments
    -Give a meaningful name to the method
  2)Add @Test annotation on top of the method  
  3)Right Click Run as->TestNG


  How to generate XMl file:

    -Select all the testcases to run
    -Right click-TestNG-Convert to TestNG
    -Xml structure will open
    -Click Finish
    -testng xml file will be generated at the bottom of your project
    -Open xml file
      -Make sure to click source tab

 XMl structure:

    Suite: All testcases together in a xml
    Test: Map it with a module of your app     
WEbTable:

   (//span[text()='Customer Analytics Table']/following::table)[2]-identify table
   (//span[text()='Customer Analytics Table']/following::table)[2]//th-identify number of columns
   (//span[text()='Customer Analytics Table']/following::table)[2]//tbody/tr-identify the number of rows

   <table>
   <tbody>
   <thead>
   <tr>
   <td></td>
   <td></td>
   <td></td>
   </tr>
   </thead>
   </tbody>
   </table>
   
   Classroom:
   Load the url(https://erail.in/)
   Uncheck sort on date
   Type Ms and press Enter(Clear)
   Type Cape and press Enter(Clear)
   Print all the trainnames 

   //table[@class='DataTable TrainList TrainListHeader stickyTrainListHeader']//tr/td[2]

Today's Agenda:

    9:30-10:00->Cucumber Introduction

    10:30-11:00->Classroom
    11:00-11:30->StepDefinition,Runner
    11:30-12:00->Shadow Dom,JavaScript click
    12:00-12:30->TestNG Listeners
Cucumber:

Test Driven Development-TDD:
    -Write the testcases first
    -Review and approve the testcases by the project team
    -Approved testcases will drive the Development

ATDD-Acceptance Test Driven Driven Development

   -Write the User Acceptance Testcases first
   -Review and approve the testcases by the project team
   -Approved testcases will drive the Development

Behaviour Driven Development-BDD:

  -BDD Automation tool
  -To solve the communication gap between the non tech team(business analyst) and the technical team(Dev&Testers)
  -Test scenarios will be captured as behaviours using common language which is understandable by tech and
   non tech team
  -Approved testcases will drive the development 

 Gherkin keywords:

  Feature: used to describe the fuctionality
  Scenario: used to describe a testcase
  Given: Used to precondition
  When: Used to represent the test step / condition
  Then: Used to represent the expected result for positive scenario
  But: Used to represent the expected result for negative scenario
  And: Used as a conjuction when we have BDD keywords repeating consequtively
  Background: common pre conditions
  Scenario Outline and Examples: To pass multiple data

Layers of Cucumber:
  3 Layers
   -Features
   -Step StepDefinition
   -Runner 
Steps to Create Feature file
  
  1)Under src/test/java Create 3 packages
     - features
        -Right click ->New->Other->File->Next->Login.feature->Finish
       Feature:
          Start with uppercase
          End with semicolon
          white space after colon
       Scenario:
         Open the Chrome Browser
         Load the application url
         Enter the username as Demosalesmanager
         Enter the password as crmsfa
         Click on login button
         HomePage should be displayed

     - steps
     - runner

Classroom:
 
 -Create features,steps,runner package
 -Create a feature file for Login
 -Write BDD steps for Login with psoitive credential

Exception:
   -UndefinedStepException
     If a step is not defined in the step defintion  for feature file  
   -DuplicateStepDefinitionException
     If same code is repeating in the StepDefinition  


Steps to implement Step Definition and Runner
  Create a class StepDefinition
    -Create 6 methods for each BDD keywords inside Scenario
    -Write Java code inside each method
    -Annotate each method with cucumber annotation 
    -Integrate feature step with Step Definition
 Create a class CucumberRunner
   -CucumberRunner should extends AbstractTestNGCucumberTests
   -On the top of the class
     @CucumberOptions(features="",glue="",monochrome=true,publish=true)

Retry Failed Testcases programatically:
======================================
IRetryAnalyzer-Interface
  -Retry
SelfClass implements IRetryAnalyzer
IAnnotationTransformer  


test-output folder->execute testng-failed.xml

Steps to handle  shadow Dom:
  1)Find the element and put in the Dom
  2)Check whether it is getting highlighted
  3)If it is not highlighting
    -use sukgu dependency
      <dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.sukgu</groupId>
    <artifactId>automation</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.4</version>
</dependency>
4)Create an object for Shadow class
5)Using shadow object use findElementByXpath and click


 -JavaScriptException
 -ELementNotInteractableException

 JavaScript click
 driver.executeScript("arguments[0].click();", ele);
